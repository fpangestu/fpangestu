# Hello, I'm Feki Pangestu ðŸ‘‹
I am a master's student in Computer Science specializing in Artificial Intelligence. With a strong academic background and a deep understanding of AI robotics and machine learning, I am passionate about applying these technologies to real-world problems. During my bachelor's degree, I gained 4 years of research experience in robotics, IoT, and microcontrollers. This experience has equipped me with the skills to bridge the gap between academia and industry. Currently, I am actively involved in several projects as part of my master's studies, like EMG Signal Classification using LSTM, Robot Control using Hand Gesture Recognition, and Deep Learning-based Implementation of Telerobotic Control with Gesture Recognition from EMG Signals. I am excited about the opportunities in AI Robotic Engineering and ML Engineering, and I am constantly seeking new challenges to enhance my skills further and contribute to advancing these fields.

## My Projects
Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

- [Project 1](https://github.com/fpangestu/myo-project): Deep Learning-based Implementation of Telerobotic Control with Gesture Recognition from EMG Signals: This research project aims to leverage deep learning methods to enable telerobotic control using gesture recognition techniques applied to EMG signals. The goal is to enhance the usability and intuitiveness of remote robot control systems.
- [Project 2](https://github.com/fpangestu/emg): EMG Signal Classification using LSTM: This project focuses on developing a deep learning-based system to classify electromyography (EMG) signals for various applications in human-computer interaction and medical diagnostics.
- [Project 3](https://github.com/fpangestu/summer_project): Robot Control using Hand Gesture Recognition: In this project, I am exploring computer vision techniques and machine learning algorithms to enable robots to interpret and respond to hand gestures, allowing for intuitive human-robot interaction.
- [Project 4](https://github.com/fpangestu/summer_project_v2): Robot Control using Hand Gesture Recognition V2: This project is an updated version of the previous "Robot Control using Hand Gesture Recognition" project, with the addition of an active learning feature.
- [Project 5](https://github.com/fpangestu/PPI_Hongary): Website for Indonesian Student Association: This project involved creating a WordPress-based website to provide a platform for Indonesian students in Hungary to connect, share information, and foster a sense of community.
